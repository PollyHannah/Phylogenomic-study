Host:    nova.rsb.anu.edu.au (AVX512, FMA3, 2267 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -t concat.treefile --gcf loci.treefile --prefix concord
Seed:    602286 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Tue Sep  2 13:16:55 2025
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (384 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 384 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading tree concat.treefile ...
un-rooted tree with 58 taxa and 113 branches
Reading tree(s) file loci.treefile ...
68 tree(s) loaded (0 rooted and 68 unrooted)

Tree with concordance factors written to concord.cf.tree
Annotated tree (best viewed in FigTree) written to concord.cf.tree.nex
Tree with branch IDs written to concord.cf.branch
Concordance factors per branch printed to concord.cf.stat
WARNING: You probably want the --scfl option. The site concordance factor
 implemented with the --scf option is based on parsimony (described here:
 https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa106). It has since been superseded by a more
 accurate likelihood-based approach which is implemented in the --scfl option, and
 is described in the paper "Updated site concordance factors minimize effects of
 homoplasy and taxon sampling" by Yu et al.. Please see the tutorial here for more
