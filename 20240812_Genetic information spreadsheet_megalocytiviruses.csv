Characterization of a new member of Iridoviridae, Shrimp hemocyte iridescent virus (SHIV), found in white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)

Qui et al. (2018)
Complete genome sequence of shrimp hemocyte iridescent virus (SHIV) isolated from white leg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei","2017, 2018","Qiu et al (2017) - In Vivo
Qiu et al. (2017) - In vitro ","Qiu et al. (2017) 
Yes, Phylogenetic analyses of amino acid sequences of MCP and ATPase genes. The tree done using the  maximum-likelihood method using Geneious wioth % bootstrap support shown having done (1000 
replicates).

Qiu et al. (2018)
a) A concatonated phylogenetic tree of core genes amino acid sequences for SHIV and 15 other whole genomes of iridescent viruses was completed. The Multiple sequence alignment was done using MUSCLE and a maximum liklihood tree was prepared using MEGA 5.0 with bootstraps.

B) A second phylogeny was prepared with 16 of what they say are 27 core genes from 34 iridescent virus genomes with % bootstraps shown (1000 replicates)
","Qiu et al. (2017) 
Fish were challenged with either intramuscular injection or anal reverse gavage. 

Also used histology and transmission electron microscopy to characterise the virus. 

Qiu et al. (2018) 
The genomes was sequences using Illumina technology and a program called BLAST2GO was used to annotate the genome/identify ORFs.
","

This is the first paper to characterise SHIV.

Six angelfish P. scalare samples in which MCV had been detected by real-time PCR  were provided by Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) Diagnostics and Laboratory Services Sustainability & Biosecurity (WA).  

The fish were legally imported from Southeast Asia and inspected in 2016 while in quarantine. WA used to test all imported ornamentals but stoped as it got too expensive. The fish samples were kept at −20°C for 2 yr and transported to ACDP, Geelong. ",Yes - phylogenic analysis of MCP gene which was compared to 33 Genbank entries of other Megalocytiviruses. A phylogenic tree was constructed using MEGA 7.0 and neighbour-joining method with default parameters and 1000 bootstrap replicates.,"DNA libraries were prepped using Nextera (Illumina). A quantity and quality check of the multiplexed DNA libraries by Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen) and Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) was peformed and paired-end sequencing of the libraries was performed with a v3 chemistry 600 cycle reagent kit on a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina).

Genes were assembles using default settings in SPADES v.3.12.0.","From Genbank:

phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA 6.0 with 1000 bootstrap replicates. 

For phylogenetic analysis, 29 previously published sequences of ISKNV (13 sequences), RSIV (12 sequences), TRBIV (4 sequences) and an out group (Brown-spotted grouper virus; GenBank accession no. AY666015) were aligned with sequences of the clinical and vaccine samples in the study. ","Tested a newly-designed PCR method were subjected to PCR amplification using universal primers MMCP-F and MMCP-R. The expected amplicon (1362 bp) from each positive sample was gel purified using a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, U.S.) and cloned into pPrime cloning vector (5PRIME).

Three recombinant clones from each infected sample and 6 clones from the vaccine sample were subjected for Sanger sequencing (1st BASE Pte Ltd., Malaysia) using T7 and SP6 primers. 

Assembly offorward and revere sequences was carried out using Contig Express (VNTI version 10.1, Invitrogen Corporation, 2006). Consensus sequences were obtained from 3 clones of the clinical samples and 6 clones of the vaccine sample. 

A homology search was performed using Nucleotide-BLAST program (NCBI). 

The consensus sequences of the clinical isolate and vaccine isolate were translated into protein sequences using MEGA 6.0 and sequence alignments were performed using Clustal Omega . 

Molecular modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the two MCP proteins was performed with Phyre2 web-based tool and visualized by PyMOL program. Antigenic plots were predicted by the algorithms of Kolaskar and Tongaonkar vailable at http://tools. immuneepitope.org/bcell.","From Genbank:

The recombinant plasmids were routinely isolated and manipulated. DNA sequencing was carried out using Thermo SequinaseTM cycle sequencing kit and a DNA sequencer, Model 4000L (Li-COR). For each PCR fragments, three to four clones were sequenced to verify replication error","From Genbank:

Both analyses were implemented using the Geneious Pro workbench (version 5.6.3; Biomatters Ltd).,"PCR detection of Megalocytivirus was conducted
using the nested PCR method of Whittington et al. (2009).

The purified PCR products was then sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility (Perth) for commercial Sanger sequencing using the original forward and reverse primers used for PCR amplification. Forward and reverse sequences were aligned using the Sequencher 4.8 software (Gene Codes) and a consensus sequence determined for each individual. Consensus sequences from each individual species were aligned using ClustalX 2.0.12 (Larkin et al. 2007).

The Megalocytivirus sequence was used to interrogate the NCBI BLAST database to confirm its likely identity.

 Sequences identified representing the major clades of previously identified megalocytiviruses and an alignment of the MCP gene region prepared using ClustalX 2.0.12. 

The resultant alignment was manually edited using the Geneious Pro workbench (version 6.0.5; Biomatters Ltd) to generate an alignment corresponding to 332 bp of the Megalocytivirus MCP gene. ","From Genbank:

a) One tree comparing the IIV-C protiens across irirdoviridae (including megalocytiviruses). 
B) A phylogenetic tree of 11 concatonated core genes from the iridescent virus and similar genes in other iridoviridae genomes using Kalign. 

An unroot tree was generated using the maximum likelihood method. To correct multiple substitutions, the WAG model was used. Use another model for corrections as well, the 'gamma model for correction'. Made these corrections using Phyml. Bootstrap analysis was done. ","The DNA was initially isolated from Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus larvae and was incompletely
digested and the large fragment wers cloned into the a site of a plasmid vector and grown in E. coli cells. 

ORFs longer than 30 and with a STOP codon were analysed for coding potential by the

using the concatenated sequences of 25 core proteins of IVs. Each protein was aligned separately using Muscle Web Server  The alignments were trimmed using TrimAl 1.3 to remove less conserved positions. The trimmed alignments of the 25 conserved proteins were then concatenated using Mesquite. An unrooted maximal likelihood tree was generated using PhyML 3.0 combined with Smart Model Selection. The LG+G+I+F model was identified as the optimal for maximal likelihood analysis in this case. A bootstrap test was carried out
with 500 replicates.",,Note: I think this may be in fact be a decapodirivovirus. The decapodiridovirus has not yet been establishedwhen this paper was writte. There is a whole genome available for decapodiridovirus with accession number: MF59946. Perhaps this one just has not been classified in GenBank yet as decapodiridovirus.  ,,,
