# Recombination detection with RDP4

This is where I ran the program RDP4 to detect recombination amoung the species *Megalocytivirus pagrus1*, the only group for which a whole genome alignment was feasible (which is required to run the program RDP4). I followed the [RDP4 Instruction Manual](https://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~darren/RDP4Manual.pdf) to complete the analysis.
You will need the following software:
RDP4 (version RDP4.101) (Martin et al. 2015)

## Step 1: Generate whole genome alignment
I generated a whole genome alignment for all *M. pagrus1* genomes part of my analysis, using the program Mauve. The alignment can be found  in this repository called `alignment_mpagrus1.fas`.
