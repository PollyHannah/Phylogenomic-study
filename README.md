# Phylogenomic analysis 

## About 
This project aims to conduct a phylogenetic analyses of megalocytiviruses, a group of fish pathogens exotic to Australia, providing robust information with which to propose a clear and simple nomenclature of this group. This is a pipeline designed to produce a Maximum Likelihood species tree for megalocytiviruses and closely related viruses by concatonating a set of core genes present across all genomes. 

Megalocytivirus is a genus of fish pathogens belonging to the family of viruses the Iridoviridae.
