Host:    c148 (AVX2, FMA3, 503 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s ./orthofinder/Results_Jul04/WorkingDirectory/Alignments_ids/OG0000174.fa -pre ./orthofinder/Results_Jul04/WorkingDirectory/Alignments_ids/OG0000174
Seed:    290775 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Jul  4 10:41:27 2024
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (24 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 24 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
